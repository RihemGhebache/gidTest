gidTest
=======
gidTest is a simplistic test framework for Gideros Mobile applications (http://www.giderosmobile.com/)

How to use
=======
Load this fully working project with example test_cases into Gideros Studio.  
Clone the projecy somewhere and open the gidTest.proj file into Gideros Studio and run the Project.

This shows something like this in the console:

    ------[ gidTest tests: 3 ]------
    test_type Succeeded
    test_true Succeeded
    test_false Failed: This test fails
    ------[ Result: Failed (2/3)]-----


Work in progress
=======
Committed an initial version, now I am going to work with it and see into what it grows.  
Be warned: In its current state gidTest is a very amateuristic framework :)
